#Extensive-Authentication-System-and-Password-Cheker
Built a secure user authentication system in Python featuring registration, login, and password validation.

ðŸ§© Features:
â€¢ Registration, login, and exit options via CLI
â€¢ Password validation: minimum 8 characters, one uppercase, one number, one symbol
â€¢ SHA-256 hashing for password storage
â€¢ Login history tracking (registration and login timestamps)
â€¢ Secure and user-friendly interface

ðŸ§  Key Concepts:
Hashing (SHA-256) | Authentication | Password Validation | File I/O | Python Security

This project improved my knowledge of password security, hashing algorithms, and user management systems.
